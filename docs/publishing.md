> Steps for publishing the monorepo

1. Make sure your local branch is up-to-date by running
   `git pull upstream master`
2. Run `yarn sync` to make sure all packages are synced
3. Make sure your git status is clean (will also be checked in our publish
   task), if not commit and push changes, then go to Step 1
4. Make sure dependencies are up-to-date by doing `yarn clean` && `yarn install`
5. Run `yarn build` to build all package assets
6. Run `./tasks/publish.sh` with the appropriate flags (see release steps below)

## Pre-release

6. Run
   `./tasks/publish.sh --exact --preid alpha --cd-version prerelease --force-publish=* --npm-tag alpha`
7. Confirm package changes

## Release

6. Set `GH_TOKEN` in your terminal ENV, the specific value will be for the
   `carbon-bot` functional ID and can be received from another team member.
7. Export value above by writing `export GH_TOKEN=XYZ`
8. Run
   `./tasks/publish.sh ---exact --conventional-commits --github-release --git-remote upstream`

## Publishing older library versions

We offer ad-hoc backwards-support for older version of the system. This work is
primarly driven by external contributors who may still need these older versions
for legacy code. When updates are received and merged into the codebase, the
release process will be a bit different than the one described above.

For example, with
[`carbon-components-react`](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-react)
we have specific branches for older major versions like `v5` or `v6`. If we
wanted to publish an update to either of these major versions, this process
would look like:

- Checkout the branch locally, making sure to pull in the latest from upstream
- Manually update `package.json` with the new version to publish in a branch
  called `chore/release-vX.Y.Z` and a commit message: `chore(release): vX.Y.Z`
- Create a Pull Request with this new branch and commit message
- Once this is merged into the branch, checkout locally and pull latest. Now we
  can publish by running `npm publish .`, if you want to do a dry run first you
  can do `npm publish . --dry-run`. This is helpful when dependencies may be
  different than in newer versions of the system

One important thing to verify is that `package.json` has a `publishConfig` field
that looks like the following:

```json
{
  "publishConfig": {
    "tag": "<VERSION>.x"
  }
}
```

For example, `carbon-components-react` v5 would look like:

```json
{
  "publishConfig": {
    "tag": "5.x"
  }
}
```

This tag verifies that when we publish we do not publish to the `latest` tag but
instead to the major-specific tag for the package.

After running `npm publish .` and seeing the package publish to the registry,
you could create a git tag by running:

```bash
git tag -a vX.Y.Z # The commit message should match vX.Y.Z
```

You should then push this tag to the project by running:

```bash
git push upstream vX.Y.Z
```

This helps keep track of what versions have been published and snapshotting the
code at that point in time.

## FAQ

#### How do I fix the repo state if I cancel during a publish?

The first things Lerna will do are create a git tag and update `package.json`
versions. If you cancel before any packages publish, then you can do the
following:

```bash
# Delete the specific tag, usually something like v0.1.0
git tag -d name-of-tag
```

```bash
# Undo the last commit
git reset HEAD~

# Remove all staged files
git checkout -- .
```

You should be good to go after this!
